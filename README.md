## Future-Development

Meals are a great way to help someone in this situation. The difficulty for the family needing help is getting too much food at one time or foods family members do not like. This section of the application will display dates a meal would be appreciated and meal ideas to decrease waste by sending food items which may not be useful due to restrictions, allergies or preferences. This page also provides useful tips such as requesting small serving sizes and donating fresh fruit and produce so the family does not need to go to the grocery store as often.
