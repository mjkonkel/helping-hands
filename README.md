# Helping-Hands

## Description 

This app is designed for friends and family to help a loved one going through a significant medical condition. It answers the question let me know if I can help. Designed to allow a family to ask and accept help without embarassment or creating additional burdens. 

Meals are a great way to help someone in this situation. The difficulty for the family needing help is getting too much food at one time or foods family members do not like. The first section of the application will display dates a meal would be appreciated and meal ideas to decrease waste by sending food items which may not be useful due to restrictions, allergies or preferences. This page also provides useful tips such as requesting small serving sizes and donating fresh fruit and produce so the family does not need to go to the grocery store as often. 

The secion section of the application will offer ideas for friends and family to provider other ways to help. This section would include items such as good playdate time for any children in the home, caring for animals, yardwork or housework. 

The third section provides an area for the family to post medical updates while allowing friends to post comments. There is also a photo carousel so those who may not be able be there physically may still feel close to their loved one who is ill.

Finally, there is a donation section for the family for those who wish to provide monetary support for necessary costs incurred with illness such as gas, hotel stays, time off work.
